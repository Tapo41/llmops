# README: Data Exploration for Tuning a Foundation Model

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a data exploration pipeline to prepare and preprocess data from Stack Overflow for fine-tuning a foundation model using Google Cloud's Vertex AI and BigQuery. The dataset includes Stack Overflow questions and answers, with a focus on Python-related queries for effective model tuning.
